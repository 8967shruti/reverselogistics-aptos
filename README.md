Project Title: Aptos Reverse Logistics Smart Contract

Project Description: The Aptos Reverse Logistics Smart Contract is a blockchain-based solution designed to revolutionize how businesses handle product returns and repairs. Built on the Aptos blockchain using the Move programming language, this smart contract creates a transparent, immutable, and efficient system for managing reverse logistics processes.
This lightweight implementation (under 50 lines of core logic) provides powerful functionality for tracking the entire lifecycle of return and repair requests. The contract maintains a permanent record of all customer requests, merchant approvals, and status updates, ensuring accountability and visibility throughout the process.

Key features include:

Creation of return or repair requests with detailed information
Status tracking (Pending, Approved, Rejected, Completed)
Permanent record-keeping on the blockchain
Clear distinction between returns and repairs
Timestamp tracking for compliance and analysis

The contract is designed to be simple to implement while providing robust functionality that meets the needs of modern e-commerce and retail operations.

Project Vision: My vision for the Blockchain Reverse Logistics project is to transform an often overlooked but critical aspect of the supply chain. By bringing reverse logistics onto the blockchain, 
I aim to: Increase Transparency: Create an environment where customers and merchants have complete visibility into the status and history of return and repair requests, eliminating confusion and building trust.

Reduce Friction: Streamline the returns and repairs process by providing clear status updates and immutable record-keeping, reducing the need for multiple customer service interactions.

Enable Data-Driven Decisions: Provide businesses with accurate, tamper-proof data about return and repair patterns to drive product improvements and operational efficiencies.

Build Consumer Confidence: Give consumers peace of mind when making purchases, knowing that the return or repair process will be transparent and fair if needed.

Lower Operational Costs: Help businesses reduce the high costs associated with managing returns and repairs through increased efficiency and automation.

Promote Sustainability: Support circular economy initiatives by making it easier to track items through repair and return cycles, potentially reducing waste.

By leveraging blockchain technology for reverse logistics, we're not just digitizing an existing processâ€”we're fundamentally reimagining how products flow back through the supply chain, creating value for businesses and customers alike.
